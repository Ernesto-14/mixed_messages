# Mixed Messages

*A JavaScript program that generates a random message every time the script is executed*

### Description

An object stores four string arrays, each one of them contains the parts of the message which is conformed of: 
* a greet
* a question
* an answer to that question 
* and a final wish.

The object has a method for every array that selects randomly an index and returns a string.

The final message is generated by a function that takes as a parameter the messages object.

### Notes
**I would like to add this script in an upcoming website project**
